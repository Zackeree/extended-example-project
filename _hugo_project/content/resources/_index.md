Here you'll find a brief overview of technologies used in the Radio Telescope system.
## JavaScript
If you have worked with JavaScript in the past and walked away hating it, you're probably
familiar with the bad parts of JavaScript. Whether you're 
familiar with JavaScript or not, a great resource to improve your language fluency and competence 
is [JavaScript: The Good Parts](https://github.com/transidai1705/javascript-ebooks/blob/master/%5BJavaScript%20The%20Good%20Parts%201st%20Edition%20by%20Douglas%20Crockford%20-%202008%5D.pdf).
JavaScript has some seriously poorly designed language constructs, but if you know which parts to use 
and which parts to avoid, it can be a very powerful language.

### JavaScript ES6
JavaScript ES6 (also known as ECMAScript 2015) introduces some **serious** improvement to the 
language. If you hate JavaScript, you're probably familiar with the problems and frustrations 
caused by JavaScript's *function scope* variables. ES6 introduces 2 new variable initializers, 
`let` and `const`, which have *block scope* (this is what you're used to if you come from 
a C/C++/Java background, or nearly any other modern language).

Take a look at this [brief overview of new ES6 features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features).

### ES6 Module System
If you're not familiar with the module system introduced by ES6, read about it [here](https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-es6-modules/).
Again, this is used extensively in the frontend application. 

## REST
If you're not familiar with at least the basics of REST API design, read [here](https://restfulapi.net/).

## Kotlin
If you're new to Kotlin, a great way to learn the syntax is [Kotlin Koans](https://try.kotlinlang.org), 
essentially a web-based sandbox environment.

## Gradle
The backend app is managed with Gradle. If you're not familiar, you can [get started here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/tutorial_using_tasks.html).
